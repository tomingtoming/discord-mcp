## Discord.js Feature Coverage

This MCP server currently implements a minimal subset of Discord.js capabilities:

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features

- **Basic Messaging**
  - Send text messages to channels
  - Read recent messages from channels
  - View message metadata (author, timestamp, attachments)

- **Channel Operations**
  - List text channels in a guild

- **Guild Operations**
  - List guilds (servers) the bot is in

### üî® Potentially Implementable Features

These Discord.js features could be added to enhance MCP functionality:

- **Advanced Messaging**
  - Message editing/deletion
  - Reactions management
  - Embeds and rich content
  - Thread operations
  - Direct messages
  - Message search and filtering

- **Channel Management**
  - Create/delete channels
  - Modify channel settings
  - Channel permissions management
  - Category organization

- **User & Member Management**
  - Fetch user/member information
  - Role assignment/removal
  - Basic moderation (kick, ban, timeout)

- **Content Management**
  - File uploads (with size limitations)
  - Webhook execution
  - Scheduled messages

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited/Challenging via MCP

These features face technical limitations in the MCP architecture:

- **Real-time Features**
  - Live event streaming (requires persistent connections)
  - Presence updates
  - Typing indicators
  - Voice state changes

- **Interactive Features**
  - Slash command responses (requires real-time handling)
  - Button/select menu interactions
  - Modal dialogs (requires immediate response)

### üö´ Not Suitable for MCP

These features are incompatible with MCP's request-response model:

- **Voice Features**
  - Voice channel audio streaming
  - Real-time audio processing
  - Voice recording

- **Persistent Features**
  - Long-running event listeners
  - Auto-moderation rules
  - Continuous monitoring

For features requiring real-time interaction or persistent connections, consider using Discord.js directly alongside MCP for the best of both worlds.
